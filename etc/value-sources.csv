anci1242,rmforms,"In Ancient Greek, the relative pronoun, inflected for case, gender, and number, is a specialized one not used in any other function. It comes from PIE *yo- and is cognate with the Sanskrit relative pronoun, among others (Schwyzer 1990a: 614). The main clause optionally has a coreferential demonstrative pronoun (Schwyzer 1990b: 640). – Occasionally, these demonstrative pronouns, which go back to PIE *so-/to-, are used as relative pronouns as well. They were even used in indirect questions in some instances. This remains rare in the Attic dialect, in which these constructions only appear in a few vulgar inscriptions (Schwyzer 1990b: 642). – The neuter singular form hó is used as a complementizer as well, either by itself or in combination with the particle te or the interrogative ti (Schwyzer 1990b: 645-646). The latter is the most frequent complementizer and also the neuter singular form of the indefinite pronoun hóti ‘whatever’. Uses of ho as a complementizer remain rare.",schwyzer_griechische_1990; schwyzer_griechische_1990-1
clas1249,rmforms,"In Classical Armenian, the interrogative pronoun or ‘which’ is used for marking relative clauses. It is inflected for case and agrees with the head noun in number. Armenian lost its gender system, so there is no gender agreement and the same form is used for all antecedents. There are multiple suggestions with respect to the etymology of this pronoun and there is no consensus among scholars yet. Godel (1975: 35) proposes that it comes from *yoro-, an extended form PIE *yo- (the relative pronoun used in most of Indic languages, among others). A more recent proposal by Kölligan (2006) argues that it is derived from the PIE interrogative *kwo- combined with a focus particle. An in depth discussion and assessment of these proposals goes beyond the scope of this study, but it is worth noting that in the argument for the interrogative source is predominantly based on structural similarity to Slavic languages and there is little evidence for the sound laws involved. Since the use of interrogatives in relative clauses spreads easily to other languages – even non-IE ones – it appears that there are more arguments in favor of a non-interrogative origin. – Although there is no differentiation between the interrogative and relative pronoun paradigm per se, but the plural forms are predominantly used in relative clauses (Jensen 1959: 86-87). The interrogative-relative pronoun is not used as complementizer (whose forms are zi and et’(e)) (Jensen 1959: 201-202).",godel_introduction_1975; jensen_altarmenische_1959; kolligan_armenian_2006
cune1239,rmforms,"Luwian is attested in two different scripts, Cuneiform and Hieroglyphs. It is unclear whether these two forms should be regarded as different dialects or just a temporal stratification, since they are attested in different time periods (Melchert 2003: 171). – Relative clauses are marked by the interrogative pronoun kwi-/kwa- ‘who, what’, which is inflected for case, animacy, and number. In relative clauses, this pronoun is not necessarily preposed, but can also appear in situ. Various subordinating conjunctions are derived from the interrogative-relative pronoun, such as kwati ‘if; so that’ (Payne 2004: 27), but there is no information on complement clauses. It is thus not clear whether a form of this pronoun was also used as a complementizer.",melchert_language_2003; payne_hieroglyphic_2004

hitt1242,rmforms,"Hittite uses the interrogative pronoun kuiš ‘who, what; which’ to mark relative clauses. It is inflected for case, animacy, and number. In both interrogative and relative function, it can also be used attributively. The interrogative kuwapi ‘where’ is also used in RCs. Question words either appear at the beginning of the clause or in second position, and do not remain in situ. The same is true when kui- is used as a relative clause marker (Hoffner & Melchert 2008: 350-353). The inanimate form kuit is also used as a complementizer (Hoffner & Melchert 2008: 415).",hoffner_grammar_2008
nucl1235,rmforms,"Modern Eastern Armenian relative clauses continue without much change from Classical Armenian: they are marked by the interrogative pronoun or ‘which’. The paradigm has been further reduced and restructured compared to Classical Armenian. Furthermore, in spoken language, and increasingly also in written language, the singular form is commonly used for plural head nouns. For inanimate antecedents the interrogative ‘what’ inč’ is sometimes used as well (Dum-Tragut 2009: 155-156). While this was not the case in Classical Armenian, the nominative singular of the relative pronoun or is now also used as a complementizer, but is invariable in that function (Dum-Tragut 2009: 425).",dum-tragut_armenian_2009
tokh1242,rmforms,"Tocharian A and B are two closely related extinct languages, formerly spoken in the Tarim Basin (present-day China). They are sometimes referred to as East Tocharian (A) and West Tocharian (B), respectively. In both Tocharian A and B the interrogative pronoun ‘what, who’ is used to mark relative clauses. Although the paradigm is somewhat reduced in comparison to that of other pronouns and nouns, it does inflect for case, but not for number or gender. The pronoun is composed of the root ku- and inflected forms of the proximal demonstrative su, see Table 5. The former part comes from PIE *kwi-/kwo-, while the latter goes back to the PIE demonstrative *so-/to-. In Tocharian A, an element ne is added in relative clauses, but it does not necessarily appear directly after kus (indicated by a = in the table). – In addition, there are attributive interrogative-relative pronouns (‘which’) in both languages. There are gaps in the paradigm due to limited attestation, and one of them is only found in Tochar- ian B (see Table 6). Their origin is unclear, but they also consist of the demonstrative su as their second part (Krause & Thomas 1960: 165-167). – Although ku-se and ku-s=ne do appear in other subordinate clauses apart from relative ones, this is a relatively late development in both languages and remains rare. Moreover, they almost never appear in complement clauses (Hackstein 2012: 120).",krause_tocharisches_1960; hackstein_evolution_2012
